## Claude Code execution

Apply this workflow when explicitly requested, or read it as a dependency of an explicitly requested pstack workflow. Read sibling pstack skills from this installation, not from another host's roots. Project skills belong under `.claude/skills`; personal skills under `~/.claude/skills`.

Delegate through the Agent tool with an available agent type, such as general-purpose; use only parameters exposed by this session. Delegate only when current instructions permit it. Read `~/.pstack/claude-models.md` for confirmed role preferences; otherwise inherit the host model. `inherit-parent` means omit an override, not a model ID. Same-model reviewers are not a multi-model panel. When delegation is unavailable, label sequential work as such; a required independent-review gate remains incomplete.

Use accessible current-workspace history and authorized tools. Missing history, live control, scheduling, or external integrations is a reported limitation. Monitoring lasts only while the session actually runs unless a supported scheduler is verified. Preserve the user's scope and authority for messages, merges, deployments, and destructive actions. Required evidence gates remain blocked until real evidence exists.

Claude manual-only dependencies must be read as files; do not invoke them through the Skill tool or preload them as model-invoked skills.

# TypeScript best practices

Apply the **type-system-discipline** principle skill first.

| Rule | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Discriminated unions | Model variants with a `kind` literal discriminant so impossible states can't be represented. No optional-field bags. |
| Branded types | Brand primitives with `& { readonly __brand: "X" }` so they can't be mixed up. Validate once at the boundary. |
| Constructive modeling | Build the shape so the illegal value can't be constructed. `[T, ...T[]]` for non-empty, `[T, T][]` for even length, `start` plus `duration` for a range. Not a runtime guard, not a wish for refinement types. |
| Simplest total type | Keep `T[]` while every operation on it stays total. Strengthen to `NonEmpty<T>` only where the loose type forces `!`, a cast, or a "should never happen" throw. |
| `unknown` over `any` | External data is `unknown`. |
| Schemas before guards | Before hand-writing a property-by-property type guard, use the repository's runtime schema library and infer the type from the schema, such as `z.infer`. |
| No `as` casts | Every `as` is a runtime crash waiting. Cast only after validation. |
| Narrowing hierarchy | Discriminant switch > `in` operator > `typeof`/`instanceof` > user-defined type guard > `as`. |
| Type guards | Must verify the claim. A lying guard is worse than `as` because the bug hides behind a name that says it's safe. Name them `isX` or `hasX`. |
| Exhaustiveness | Inline `const _exhaustive: never = x;` in default arms so the compiler errors when a new variant is added. |
| `satisfies` over `as` | Validates the value without widening literal types. |
| Boundary validation | Parse where data crosses in, into a named domain type. `Record<string, unknown>` (however spelled) stops at that parse. Trust types inside. See the **boundary-discipline** principle skill. |
| Schema-derived types | Reach for `Pick`/`Omit`/`Parameters`/`ReturnType`/`Awaited`/`typeof` before declaring a new interface. |
| Object args | Pass objects, not positional, so argument order is self-documenting. Skip on hot paths (per-frame render, tokenizers, parsers). |
| Real tests | Don't mock what you can run. Prefer the framework's real test primitives with leak/disposable checks, and verify UI in a running build. Mock only what you can't run locally. |
| Structured telemetry | Prefer structured logger diagnostics with enough context to debug from an id. No `console.log` in shipped code. |
