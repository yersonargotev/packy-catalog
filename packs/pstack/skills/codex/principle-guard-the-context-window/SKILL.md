## Codex execution

Apply this workflow when explicitly requested, or read it as a dependency of an explicitly requested pstack workflow. Read sibling pstack skills from this installation, not from another host's roots. Project skills belong under `.agents/skills`; personal skills under `~/.agents/skills`.

Delegate through the available Codex subagent API; use only its advertised agent types and parameters. Delegate only when current instructions permit it. Read `~/.pstack/codex-models.md` for confirmed role preferences; otherwise inherit the host model. `inherit-parent` means omit an override, not a model ID. Same-model reviewers are not a multi-model panel. When delegation is unavailable, label sequential work as such; a required independent-review gate remains incomplete.

Use accessible current-workspace history and authorized tools. Missing history, live control, scheduling, or external integrations is a reported limitation. Monitoring lasts only while the session actually runs unless a supported scheduler is verified. Preserve the user's scope and authority for messages, merges, deployments, and destructive actions. Required evidence gates remain blocked until real evidence exists.

# Guard the Context Window

The context window is finite and non-renewable within a session. Every token should be worth its cost.

**Why:** Context overflow degrades reasoning quality, creates compression artifacts, and halts progress.

**Pattern:**
- **Isolate large payloads.** Route verbose outputs, screenshots, and large documents to subagents. The main context gets summaries, not raw data.
- **Keep frequently used content inline.** Templates and references used on every invocation belong in the skill file, not in separate files that cost a read each time.
- **Size phases and cap scope.** Limit files per phase, set turn budgets, account for mechanism costs.
