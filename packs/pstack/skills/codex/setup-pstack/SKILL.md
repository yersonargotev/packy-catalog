## Codex execution

Read sibling pstack skills from this installation, not from another host's roots. Project skills belong under `.agents/skills`; personal skills under `~/.agents/skills`.

Delegate through the available Codex subagent API; use only its advertised agent types and parameters. Delegate only when current instructions permit it. Read `~/.pstack/codex-models.md` for confirmed role preferences; otherwise inherit the host model. `inherit-parent` means omit an override, not a model ID. Same-model reviewers are not a multi-model panel. When delegation is unavailable, label sequential work as such; a required independent-review gate remains incomplete.

Use accessible current-workspace history and authorized tools. Missing history, live control, scheduling, or external integrations is a reported limitation. Monitoring lasts only while the session actually runs unless a supported scheduler is verified. Preserve the user's scope and authority for messages, merges, deployments, and destructive actions. Required evidence gates remain blocked until real evidence exists.

# Setup pstack

Write the portable pstack preference file at `~/.pstack/codex-models.md`. Other
pstack workflows read it when they choose a worker model. It is not a host rule
and does not change the host's own model configuration.

## Steps

1. Detect the current host and the models its subagent tool actually accepts.
   A model shown in a picker is not proof that its subagent tool accepts it.
   If no model list is available, use `inherit-parent`; do not guess slugs.
2. Read an existing `~/.pstack/codex-models.md` if present. Preserve role choices
   still supported by this host. Drop retired role names.
3. Ask the user for a reasoning budget: unlimited (max), large (xhigh),
   medium (high), or small (medium). Offer large when no preference exists.
   Apply the requested tier to confirmed models, including every panel entry,
   while preserving supported role choices and panel sizes. Show the resulting
   model and reasoning tier for each role before writing. Let the user change
   individual roles. Use the host's advertised model and reasoning parameters;
   do not construct model IDs by appending a tier. Use the nearest confirmed
   lower tier when the requested tier is unavailable, and report the fallback.
   Keep `auto` and `inherit-parent` entries unchanged: omit the model override
   and inherit the host reasoning setting. If no model catalog is available,
   record the budget as a preference, not an applied reasoning tier.
4. Write the complete file atomically. Use the role names below. A panel value
   can list multiple models; each entry represents one candidate or reviewer.
   Use `inherit-parent` for a role when the host cannot select a model for it.
5. Read the file back and report the active choices and any host limitation.

Read this file only when `# host` matches the current host. On another host,
ignore its model values and use `inherit-parent` until the user configures that
host. If no subagent facility exists, run a role in the current context and
report that the review was not independent.
