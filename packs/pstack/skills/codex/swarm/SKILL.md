## Codex execution

Apply this workflow when explicitly requested, or read it as a dependency of an explicitly requested pstack workflow. Read sibling pstack skills from this installation, not from another host's roots. Project skills belong under `.agents/skills`; personal skills under `~/.agents/skills`.

Delegate through the available Codex subagent API; use only its advertised agent types and parameters. Delegate only when current instructions permit it. Read `~/.pstack/codex-models.md` for confirmed role preferences; otherwise inherit the host model. `inherit-parent` means omit an override, not a model ID. Same-model reviewers are not a multi-model panel. When delegation is unavailable, label sequential work as such; a required independent-review gate remains incomplete.

Use accessible current-workspace history and authorized tools. Missing history, live control, scheduling, or external integrations is a reported limitation. Monitoring lasts only while the session actually runs unless a supported scheduler is verified. Preserve the user's scope and authority for messages, merges, deployments, and destructive actions. Required evidence gates remain blocked until real evidence exists.

# Swarm

Fan out N workers when the host offers subagents. They may cover separate
slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and
returns one report. Local or hosted subagents are valid when they can access the required inputs.
When delegation is unavailable or disallowed, run the slices sequentially and
label the result as a sequential review.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not the cloud concurrency limit.
4. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` line in `~/.pstack/codex-models.md`. If the rule or that line is missing, use `inherit-parent`. For `auto` or `inherit-parent`, omit `model` so the workers run on the parent model. If a configured model is unavailable, inherit the host model and disclose the fallback. For a model race, name each arm's model up front.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn workers through the available host subagent tool, using only its documented parameters. Give each worker a separate worktree and explicit branch/commit when needed. Use concurrent execution only if available and authorized; otherwise process slices sequentially and report that limitation.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and rerun that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
