## Packy host adaptation

This skill originated in Cursor. On Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode, interpret
Cursor-specific tool names and parameters as examples of the operation, not as
an API contract. Use the host's available tools to achieve the same result.
Delegate only when the host offers subagents and the current instructions permit
it; otherwise perform the steps sequentially. Select a named model only when
that host confirms it is available; otherwise use the parent model or host
default. Never claim a parallel or independent review if it did not occur.
Read `~/.pstack/models.md` only when its `# host` matches the current host;
otherwise use the parent model.

When this skill refers to another pstack skill, read the sibling installed
`SKILL.md` and apply its instructions in the current context. Claude Code's
`disable-model-invocation: true` prevents invoking that skill through its Skill
tool. A user can still invoke each skill explicitly. Replace Cursor transcript,
rule, and cloud-agent paths with the active host's documented equivalents only
when accessible. If required evidence or a capability is unavailable, report the gap and
continue only with independent supported steps. A missing required gate blocks
the action it protects; do not invent a result.

# How

Explore the codebase to answer "how does X work?" questions. Produce architectural explanations at the level of a senior engineer onboarding onto a subsystem, enough to build a working mental model, not so much that it reads like annotated source code.

Each spawn below names a role line in the `~/.pstack/models.md` file and a default. Set `model` to that line's value, or to the default if the rule or the line is missing. Leave `model` unset when the value is `auto` or `inherit-parent`. If the Task tool rejects a slug, use the default and say so. If it rejects the default, use the closest valid slug of the same family from its error message.

## Step 1. Assess Complexity

If the scope is ambiguous, state your interpretation and explore. The user can redirect.

- **Simple** (a single module, a small utility, a narrow question such as "how does function X work"): no explorers. One explainer explores and explains in a single pass. Go to Step 2b.
- **Complex** (a subsystem spanning multiple files or services, a cross-cutting feature, a full architectural overview): spawn parallel explorers first, then hand off to the explainer. Go to Step 2a.

When in doubt, take the simple path.

## Step 2a. Explore (complex questions only)

Decompose the question into 2 to 4 exploration angles, each a distinct slice of the subsystem. Spawn all explorers in a single message:

- `subagent_type`: `generalPurpose`
- `model`: the `how explorer` line, default `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast`
- `readonly`: `true`

Each explorer gets the prompt in `references/explorer-prompt.md` with its angle filled in. Then go to Step 3.

## Step 2b. Direct Explain (simple questions)

Spawn one Task subagent that explores and explains in one pass:

- `subagent_type`: `generalPurpose`
- `model`: the `how explainer` line, default `claude-opus-5-5-max`
- `readonly`: `true`

Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` without the explorer-findings section. Go to Step 4.

## Step 3. Synthesize (complex questions only)

Once all explorers have returned, spawn one Task subagent to synthesize their findings into one explanation:

- `subagent_type`: `generalPurpose`
- `model`: the `how explainer` line, default `claude-opus-5-5-max`
- `readonly`: `true`

Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` with every explorer's findings filled in.

## Step 4. Present

Present the explainer's output to the user. Light edits for clarity or context from the conversation are fine. Do not substantially rewrite it.

## Output Format

The explanation uses the sections defined in `references/explainer-prompt.md`, dropping any that do not apply: Overview, Key Concepts, How It Works, Where Things Live, Gotchas.
