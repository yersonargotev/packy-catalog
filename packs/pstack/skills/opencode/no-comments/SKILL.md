## OpenCode execution

Apply this workflow when explicitly requested, or read it as a dependency of an explicitly requested pstack workflow. Read sibling pstack skills from this installation, not from another host's roots. Project skills belong under `.opencode/skills`; personal skills under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/skills (default ~/.config/opencode/skills)`.

Delegate through the task tool with an available subagent type; model selection follows that agent configuration unless the live tool exposes an override. Delegate only when current instructions permit it. Read `~/.pstack/opencode-models.md` for confirmed role preferences; otherwise use the host-selected subagent model. `inherit-parent` is a portable preference meaning omit an override, not a model ID. OpenCode may choose a different configured subagent model; report only model identities actually confirmed. Same-model reviewers are not a multi-model panel. When delegation is unavailable, label sequential work as such; a required independent-review gate remains incomplete.

Use accessible current-workspace history and authorized tools. Missing history, live control, scheduling, or external integrations is a reported limitation. Monitoring lasts only while the session actually runs unless a supported scheduler is verified. Preserve the user's scope and authority for messages, merges, deployments, and destructive actions. Required evidence gates remain blocked until real evidence exists.

OpenCode does not enforce Claude's manual-only frontmatter. This explicit-request rule is an instruction, not a native access control. Respect the user's configured skill permissions.

# No comments

Review comments and suppressions in scope. Act on accepted findings.

Use Comment Sicko when that agent is installed. Otherwise assign an available
independent reviewer this brief: identify comments that merely narrate code,
stale comments, workaround comments, `IMPORTANT` or `do not remove` claims,
lint and TypeScript suppressions, and comments that protect a real external
constraint. Require file and line evidence. The reviewer reports findings and
does not edit application code. If no independent reviewer is available,
perform the same audit directly and say that it was not independent.

## Scope

Use the caller's files or diff. Otherwise use the current diff against the base branch, default `main`, including the working tree.

## Steps

1. Run Comment Sicko when installed, or use the reviewer brief above with the
   host's available subagent tool. Pass the scope and ask for `MUST KILL`,
   `RESHAPE`, and `KEEP` findings with reasons. A direct audit uses the same
   categories.
2. Inspect its report and diff. Reject application-code edits, scope escapes, exception-protected deletions, misstated `MUST KILL` reasons, and flags that treat kept intentional code as guilty. Reshape flags on our-code surprises stay actionable. Do not restore those comments. A keep survives only with proof it is about something we cannot change. Audit missed scoped lint and TypeScript suppressions. Correctness or safety suppressions stay actionable `MUST KILL`s. Restore deletions only with exact exceptions and scoped proof. Before accepting thin `IMPORTANT` or `do not remove` kills or keeps, run `/how` or `/why` on their symbol. If a kill is ambiguous, do not restore. If a keep is refuted or still ambiguous, delete it. Revert and rerun one rejected report with the failure named. Reject a second, report it open, and fail `/no-comments`.
3. Fix trivial accepted flags directly by deleting a dead path, dropping a parameter, or using the real API. If any fix needs a shape, run `/architect` once for the accepted set and surrounding code. Stop at the sketch. Architect shapes. Step 4 implements.
4. Implement the smallest root-cause fix in scope. Remove every named workaround. If the root cause is out of scope, land the smallest in-scope fix and report the rest open. The **principle-fix-root-causes** and **principle-redesign-from-first-principles** skills guide intent only. Neither authorizes widening the fence nor fixing instances outside it. Never bolt on symptom guards.
5. Constraint comments say `do not remove`, `do not change wording`, or `talk to X before changing`. Leave keeps about things we cannot change. Offer the cheapest in-scope type, runtime, test, or CI lint. Wait for interactive approval. Unattended and eval require caller pre-approval. If approved, encode then delete. Otherwise delete, report the constraint open, and sketch out-of-scope work.
6. Report the deletion count, restored comments, reruns, architect sketch, fixes, encoding offers, encodings, unenforced constraints, and other open work.
