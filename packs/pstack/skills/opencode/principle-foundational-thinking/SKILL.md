## OpenCode execution

Apply this workflow when explicitly requested, or read it as a dependency of an explicitly requested pstack workflow. Read sibling pstack skills from this installation, not from another host's roots. Project skills belong under `.opencode/skills`; personal skills under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/skills (default ~/.config/opencode/skills)`.

Delegate through the task tool with an available subagent type; model selection follows that agent configuration unless the live tool exposes an override. Delegate only when current instructions permit it. Read `~/.pstack/opencode-models.md` for confirmed role preferences; otherwise use the host-selected subagent model. `inherit-parent` is a portable preference meaning omit an override, not a model ID. OpenCode may choose a different configured subagent model; report only model identities actually confirmed. Same-model reviewers are not a multi-model panel. When delegation is unavailable, label sequential work as such; a required independent-review gate remains incomplete.

Use accessible current-workspace history and authorized tools. Missing history, live control, scheduling, or external integrations is a reported limitation. Monitoring lasts only while the session actually runs unless a supported scheduler is verified. Preserve the user's scope and authority for messages, merges, deployments, and destructive actions. Required evidence gates remain blocked until real evidence exists.

OpenCode does not enforce Claude's manual-only frontmatter. This explicit-request rule is an instruction, not a native access control. Respect the user's configured skill permissions.

# Foundational Thinking

**Structural decisions** protect option value. **Code-level decisions** protect simplicity.

**Data structures first.** Get the data shape right before writing logic. Define core types early, trace every access pattern, and choose structures that match the dominant paths.

At code level, DRY the structure, not every line. Types and data models should converge. Three similar statements still beat a premature abstraction. Prefer explicit over clever. Test behavior and edge cases, not line counts.

**Concurrency corollary.** Before sharing state between actors, ask "what happens if another actor modifies this concurrently?" If not "nothing", isolate.

**Scaffold first.** If something helps every later phase, do it first. Ask "does every subsequent phase benefit from this existing?" CI, linting, test infrastructure, and shared types are scaffold. Sequence for option value: setup before features, tests before fixes. Keep commits small and single-purpose.

Each increment should land a coherent abstraction or deepen one that exists. Do not spread a new capability across callers as special-case coordination.

Subtraction comes before scaffolding. Remove dead code first, then lay foundations.
