## OpenCode execution

Apply this workflow when explicitly requested, or read it as a dependency of an explicitly requested pstack workflow. Read sibling pstack skills from this installation, not from another host's roots. Project skills belong under `.opencode/skills`; personal skills under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/skills (default ~/.config/opencode/skills)`.

Delegate through the task tool with an available subagent type; model selection follows that agent configuration unless the live tool exposes an override. Delegate only when current instructions permit it. Read `~/.pstack/opencode-models.md` for confirmed role preferences; otherwise use the host-selected subagent model. `inherit-parent` is a portable preference meaning omit an override, not a model ID. OpenCode may choose a different configured subagent model; report only model identities actually confirmed. Same-model reviewers are not a multi-model panel. When delegation is unavailable, label sequential work as such; a required independent-review gate remains incomplete.

Use accessible current-workspace history and authorized tools. Missing history, live control, scheduling, or external integrations is a reported limitation. Monitoring lasts only while the session actually runs unless a supported scheduler is verified. Preserve the user's scope and authority for messages, merges, deployments, and destructive actions. Required evidence gates remain blocked until real evidence exists.

OpenCode does not enforce Claude's manual-only frontmatter. This explicit-request rule is an instruction, not a native access control. Respect the user's configured skill permissions.

# Type System Discipline

Make the compiler reject impossible states, mismatched primitives, and unhandled variants. Prefer defining errors and special cases out of existence over proliferating handlers. For TypeScript syntax, see the `typescript-best-practices` skill.

- **Brand semantic primitives.** `UserId` and `OrderId` are strings underneath but should not be interchangeable. Give each its own type, such as a branded intersection in TypeScript or a newtype elsewhere. Validate once at creation, trust the type downstream. If two arguments share a primitive type but mean different things, brand them.
- **External data is untyped until parsed.** RPC payloads, JSON, IPC messages, CLI args, config files, environment variables, database rows. Have a parse function at every boundary that turns unstructured input into the typed model. The **boundary-discipline** principle skill says where to put validation.
- **Derive types from authoritative schemas.** When a protocol buffer, OpenAPI spec, GraphQL schema, database migration, design-token file, or another file owns a shape, derive from it instead of hand-rolling a parallel type. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.
