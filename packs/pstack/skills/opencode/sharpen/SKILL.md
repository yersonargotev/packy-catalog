## OpenCode execution

Apply this workflow when explicitly requested, or read it as a dependency of an explicitly requested pstack workflow. Read sibling pstack skills from this installation, not from another host's roots. Project skills belong under `.opencode/skills`; personal skills under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/skills (default ~/.config/opencode/skills)`.

Delegate through the task tool with an available subagent type; model selection follows that agent configuration unless the live tool exposes an override. Delegate only when current instructions permit it. Read `~/.pstack/opencode-models.md` for confirmed role preferences; otherwise use the host-selected subagent model. `inherit-parent` is a portable preference meaning omit an override, not a model ID. OpenCode may choose a different configured subagent model; report only model identities actually confirmed. Same-model reviewers are not a multi-model panel. When delegation is unavailable, label sequential work as such; a required independent-review gate remains incomplete.

Use accessible current-workspace history and authorized tools. Missing history, live control, scheduling, or external integrations is a reported limitation. Monitoring lasts only while the session actually runs unless a supported scheduler is verified. Preserve the user's scope and authority for messages, merges, deployments, and destructive actions. Required evidence gates remain blocked until real evidence exists.

OpenCode does not enforce Claude's manual-only frontmatter. This explicit-request rule is an instruction, not a native access control. Respect the user's configured skill permissions.

Before starting, ask how a top expert would approach this task (their raw sources, their real methods, an outside check that the result is right), what the user is really after, and whether the task is over- or underspecified. Loosen constraints that don't serve the goal as readily as you add ones that do, and leave choices that are the user's to make open instead of deciding them. Fold in only what makes the work better, not bigger, but always keep one outside check that the result is right, without narrating the framing, then do the work.
