## Host execution

Apply this workflow when explicitly requested.

On Agents, this workflow assumes Codex capabilities; a shared Agents binding does not provide Codex tools, model choice, or delegation. Use only capabilities authorized and available in the actual client. On Claude Code, read manual-only pstack dependencies as files; do not invoke them through the Skill tool or preload them as model-invoked skills.

# Exhaust the Design Space

It also applies to product design decisions where user experience depends on feel, not logic.
