# Thermo-Nuclear Code Quality Review

Use this skill for an unusually strict review focused on implementation quality, maintainability, abstraction quality, and codebase health.

## Execution contract

Apply this rubric only when the user requests this review or a parent explicitly
assigns this review pass. Review the requested diff and trace affected callers
as needed; report regressions introduced by added or modified code. Recommend
changes without editing files, committing, publishing comments, or merging.
Treat proposed structural remedies below as review recommendations.

Use the scope and base supplied by the parent or user. For a branch review,
resolve the target branch and merge base before comparing commits; for a
worktree review, include staged, unstaged, and relevant untracked files.
Read changed-file context and affected dependencies before making a finding.
Use available read/search tools and permitted read-only shell commands. If
necessary evidence is inaccessible, state the coverage gap without claiming
that an incomplete audit passed.

Return prioritized findings with file:line references, supporting evidence,
impact, and an actionable remedy. If there are no findings, say so and state
any remaining verification limits.

## Review standards

Audit the scoped changes thoroughly. Propose behavior-preserving remedies for
concrete maintainability problems using these standards:

0. **Be ambitious about structural simplification.**
   - Do not stop at "this could be a bit cleaner."
   - Look for opportunities to reframe the change so that whole branches, helpers, modes, conditionals, or layers disappear entirely.
   - Prefer the solution that makes the code feel inevitable in hindsight.
   - Assume there is often a "code judo" move available: a re-organization that uses the existing architecture more effectively and makes the change dramatically simpler and more elegant.
   - If you see a path to delete complexity rather than rearrange it, push hard for that path.

1. **Do not let a PR push a file from under 1k lines to over 1k lines without a very strong reason.**
   - Treat this as a strong code-quality smell by default.
   - Prefer extracting helpers, subcomponents, modules, or local abstractions instead of letting a file sprawl past 1000 lines.
   - If the diff crosses that threshold, explicitly ask whether the code should be decomposed first.
   - Only waive this if there is a compelling structural reason and the resulting file is still clearly organized.

2. **Do not allow random spaghetti growth in existing code.**
   - Be highly suspicious of new ad-hoc conditionals, scattered special cases, or one-off branches inserted into unrelated flows.
   - If a change adds "weird if statements in random places", treat that as a design problem, not a stylistic nit.
   - Prefer pushing the logic into a dedicated abstraction, helper, state machine, policy object, or separate module instead of tangling an existing path.
   - Call out changes that make the surrounding code harder to reason about, even if they technically work.

3. **Bias toward cleaning the design, not just accepting working code.**
   - If behavior can stay the same while the structure becomes meaningfully cleaner, push for the cleaner version.
   - Do not rubber-stamp "it works" implementations that leave the codebase messier.
   - Strongly prefer simplifications that remove moving pieces altogether over refactors that merely spread the same complexity around.

4. **Prefer direct, boring, maintainable code over hacky or magical code.**
   - Treat brittle, ad-hoc, or "magic" behavior as a code-quality problem.
   - Be skeptical of generic mechanisms that hide simple data-shape assumptions.
   - Flag thin abstractions, identity wrappers, or pass-through helpers that add indirection without buying clarity.

5. **Push hard on type and boundary cleanliness when they affect maintainability.**
   - Question unnecessary optionality, `unknown`, `any`, or cast-heavy code when a clearer type boundary could exist.
   - Prefer explicit typed models or shared contracts over loosely-shaped ad-hoc objects.
   - If a branch relies on silent fallback to paper over an unclear invariant, ask whether the boundary should be made explicit instead.

6. **Keep logic in the canonical layer and reuse existing helpers.**
   - Call out feature logic leaking into shared paths or implementation details leaking through APIs.
   - Prefer existing canonical utilities/helpers over bespoke one-offs.
   - Push code toward the right package, service, or module instead of normalizing architectural drift.

7. **Treat unnecessary sequential orchestration and non-atomic updates as design smells when the cleaner structure is obvious.**
   - If independent work is serialized for no good reason, ask whether the flow should run in parallel instead.
   - If related updates can leave state half-applied, push for a more atomic structure.
   - Do not over-index on micro-optimizations, but do flag avoidable orchestration complexity that makes the implementation more brittle.

## Choosing a remedy

Match the remedy to the violated standard: simplify the state model to remove
conditionals, clarify ownership, reuse the canonical helper, or extract a focused
function/module. A typed model or explicit dispatcher can replace scattered
condition chains; separating orchestration from business logic can expose
independent work and make related updates atomic. Judge a restructuring by the
concepts it removes and the behavior it preserves, not by how many files move.

## Review Tone

Be direct, serious, and demanding about quality.
Do not be rude, but do not soften major maintainability issues into mild suggestions.
If the code is making the codebase messier, say so clearly.
If the implementation missed an opportunity for a dramatic simplification, say that clearly too.

## Output Expectations

Prioritize findings in this order:

1. Structural code-quality regressions
2. Missed opportunities for dramatic simplification / code-judo restructuring
3. Spaghetti / branching complexity increases
4. Boundary / abstraction / type-contract problems that make the code harder to reason about
5. File-size and decomposition concerns
6. Modularity and abstraction issues
7. Legibility and maintainability concerns

Do not flood the review with low-value nits if there are larger structural issues.
Prefer a smaller number of high-conviction comments over a long list of cosmetic notes.

## Approval Bar

Correct behavior alone does not establish maintainability. Treat violations of
the review standards above as presumptive blockers when you can show a concrete
structural regression or a feasible, materially simpler implementation. Explain
the evidence and remedy, and account for a compelling justification from the
author. Favor high-conviction structural findings over cosmetic nits.
